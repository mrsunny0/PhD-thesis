  abstract = {A screen of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion strain set was performed to identify genes affecting hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production. Mutants were screened using two assays: colony color on BiGGY agar, which detects the basal level of sulfite reductase activity, and production of H2S in a synthetic juice medium using lead acetate detection of free sulfide in the headspace. A total of 88 mutants produced darker colony colors than the parental strain, and 4 produced colonies significantly lighter in color. There was no correlation between the appearance of a dark colony color on BiGGY agar and H2S production in synthetic juice media. Sixteen null mutations were identified as leading to the production of increased levels of H2S in synthetic juice using the headspace analysis assay. All 16 mutants also produced H2S in actual juices. Five of these genes encode proteins involved in sulfur containing amino acid or precursor biosynthesis and are directly associated with the sulfate assimilation pathway. The remaining genes encode proteins involved in a variety of cellular activities, including cell membrane integrity, cell energy regulation and balance, or other metabolic functions. The levels of hydrogen sulfide production of each of the 16 strains varied in response to nutritional conditions. In most cases, creation of multiple deletions of the 16 mutations in the same strain did not lead to a further increase in H2S production, instead often resulting in decreased levels.},

  abstract = {With global heavy metal contamination increasing, plants that can process heavy metals might provide efficient and ecologically sound approaches to sequestration and removal. Mercuric ion reductase, MerA, converts toxic Hg2+ to the less toxic, relatively inert metallic mercury (Hg0) The bacterial merA sequence is rich in CpG dinucleotides and has a highly skewed codon usage, both of which are particularly unfavorable to efficient expression in plants. We constructed a mutagenized merA sequence, merApe9, modifying the flanking region and 9\% of the coding region and placing this sequence under control of plant regulatory elements. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seeds expressing merApe9 germinated, and these seedlings grew, flowered, and set seed on medium containing HgCl2 concentrations of 25-100 microM (5-20 ppm), levels toxic to several controls. Transgenic merApe9 seedlings evolved considerable amounts of Hg0 relative to control plants. The rate of mercury evolution and the level of resistance were proportional to the steady-state mRNA level, confirming that resistance was due to expression of the MerApe9 enzyme. Plants and bacteria expressing merApe9 were also resistant to toxic levels of Au3+. These and other data suggest that there are potentially viable molecular genetic approaches to the phytoremediation of metal ion pollution.},

  abstract = {Sulfur compounds in wine can be a `double-edged sword'. On the one hand, certain sulfur-containing volatile compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, imparting a rotten egg-like aroma, can have a negative impact on the perceived quality of the wine, and on the other hand, some sulfur compounds such as 3-mercaptohexanol, imparting fruitiness, can have a positive impact on wine flavor and aroma. Furthermore, these compounds can become less or more attractive or repulsive depending on their absolute and relative concentrations. This presents an interesting challenge to the winemaker to modulate the concentrations of these quality-determining compounds in wine in accordance with consumer preferences. The wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae plays a central role in the production of volatile sulfur compounds. Through the sulfate reduction sequence pathway, the HS- is formed, which can lead to the formation of hydrogen sulfide and various mercaptan compounds. Therefore, limiting the formation of the HS- ion is an important target in metabolic engineering of wine yeast. The wine yeast is also responsible for the transformation of non-volatile sulfur precursors, present in the grape, to volatile, flavor-active thiol compounds. In particular, 4-mercapto-4-methylpentan-2-one, 3-mercaptohexanol, and 3-mercaptohexyl acetate are the most important volatile thiols adding fruitiness to wine. This paper briefly reviews the metabolic processes involved in the production of important volatile sulfur compounds and the latest strategies in the pursuit of developing wine yeast strains as tools to adjust wine aroma to market specifications.},

The activity of SRB increased the water pH from {$\sim$}4.5 to 7.0, and enhanced the removal of sulfate and metals in comparison to controls not inoculated with SRB. Addition of organic substrate and sulfate at loading rates of 7.43 and 3.71 kg d-1 m-3, respectively, resulted in \&gt;82\% reduction in sulfate concentration. The reactor removed more than 97.5\% of the initial concentrations of Cu, Zn and Ni, while only \&gt;77.5\% and \&gt;82\% of As and Fe were removed, respectively. In contrast, Mg and Al levels remained unchanged during the whole treatment process. The removal patterns for Cu, Zn, Ni and Fe reflected the trend in their solubility for their respective metal sulfides, while As removal appeared to coincide with decreasing Cu, Zn, Ni and Fe concentrations, which suggests adsorption or concomitant precipitation with the other metal sulfides.},

Dissimilatory sulfate reduction is used in nature by sulfate-reducing bacteria for respiration and results in the conversion of sulfate to sulfide. However, this dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway is inhibited by oxygen and is thus limited to anaerobic environments. As an alternative, we have metabolically engineered a novel aerobic sulfate reduction pathway for the secretion of sulfides. The assimilatory sulfate reduction pathway was redirected to overproduce cysteine, and excess cysteine was converted to sulfide by cysteine desulfhydrase. As a potential application for this pathway, a bacterium was engineered with this pathway and was used to aerobically precipitate cadmium as cadmium sulfide, which was deposited on the cell surface. To maximize sulfide production and cadmium precipitation, the production of cysteine desulfhydrase was modulated to achieve an optimal balance between the production and degradation of cysteine.},

Solid-state devices can efficiently capture solar energy to produce chemicals and fuels from carbon dioxide. Yet biology has already developed a high-specificity, low-cost system to do just that through photosynthesis. Sakimoto et al. developed a biological-inorganic hybrid that combines the best of both worlds (see the Perspective by M\"uller). They precipitated semiconductor nanoparticles on the surface of a nonphotosynthetic bacterium to serve as a light harvester. The captured energy sustained cellular metabolism, producing acetic acid: a natural waste product of respiration.
Science, this issue p. 74; see also p. 34
Improving natural photosynthesis can enable the sustainable production of chemicals. However, neither purely artificial nor purely biological approaches seem poised to realize the potential of solar-to-chemical synthesis. We developed a hybrid approach, whereby we combined the highly efficient light harvesting of inorganic semiconductors with the high specificity, low cost, and self-replication and -repair of biocatalysts. We induced the self-photosensitization of a nonphotosynthetic bacterium, Moorella thermoacetica, with cadmium sulfide nanoparticles, enabling the photosynthesis of acetic acid from carbon dioxide. Biologically precipitated cadmium sulfide nanoparticles served as the light harvester to sustain cellular metabolism. This self-augmented biological system selectively produced acetic acid continuously over several days of light-dark cycles at relatively high quantum yields, demonstrating a self-replicating route toward solar-to-chemical carbon dioxide reduction.
Biologically produced nanoparticles capture light for a nonphotosynthetic bacterium to produce acetic acid from carbon dioxide. [Also see Perspective by M\"uller]

A particular focus is given to chemical precipitation, coagulation\textendash{}flocculation, flotation, ion exchange and membrane filtration. Their advantages and limitations in application are evaluated. Their operating conditions such as pH, dose required, initial metal concentration and treatment performance are presented. About 124 published studies (1980\textendash{}2006) are reviewed. It is evident from the survey that ion exchange and membrane filtration are the most frequently studied and widely applied for the treatment of metal-contaminated wastewater. Ion exchange has achieved a complete removal of Cd(II), Cr(III), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) with an initial concentration of 100mg/L, respectively. The results are comparable to that of reverse osmosis (99\% of Cd(II) rejection with an initial concentration of 200mg/L). Lime precipitation has been found as one of the most effective means to treat inorganic effluent with a metal concentration of higher than 1000mg/L. It is important to note that the overall treatment cost of metal-contaminated water varies, depending on the process employed and the local conditions. In general, the technical applicability, plant simplicity and cost-effectiveness are the key factors in selecting the most suitable treatment for inorganic effluent.},

The thermochemical pretreatment gave the best results, i.e., the production of methane increased by more than 34.3\% and soluble COD (SCOD) removal also increased by more than 67.8\% over the control. In this case, the biogas production, methane production and the SCOD removal efficiency were about 5037 l biogas/m3 WAS, 3367 l methane/m3 WAS and 61.4\%, respectively.

  shorttitle = {Emerging Pollutants in the Environment},
  abstract = {Emerging pollutants reach the environment from various anthropogenic sources and are distributed throughout environmental matrices. Although great advances have been made in the detection and analysis of trace pollutants during recent decades, due to the continued development and refinement of specific techniques, a wide array of undetected contaminants of emerging environmental concern need to be identified and quantified in various environmental components and biological tissues. These pollutants may be mobile and persistent in air, water, soil, sediments and ecological receptors even at low concentrations. Robust data on their fate and behaviour in the environment, as well as on threats to ecological and human health, are still lacking. Moreover, the ecotoxicological significance of some emerging micropollutants remains largely unknown, because satisfactory data to determine their risk often do not exist. This paper discusses the fate, behaviour, (bio)monitoring, environmental and health risks associated with emerging chemical (pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, hormones, toxins, among others) and biological (bacteria, viruses) micropollutants in soils, sediments, groundwater, industrial and municipal wastewaters, aquaculture effluents, and freshwater and marine ecosystems, and highlights new horizons for their (bio)removal. Our study aims to demonstrate the imperative need to boost research and innovation for new and cost-effective treatment technologies, in line with the uptake, mode of action and consequences of each emerging contaminant. We also address the topic of innovative tools for the evaluation of the effects of toxicity on human health and for the prediction of microbial availability and degradation in the environment. Additionally, we consider the development of (bio)sensors to perform environmental monitoring in real-time mode. This needs to address multiple species, along with a more effective exploitation of specialised microbes or enzymes capable of degrading endocrine disruptors and other micropollutants. In practical terms, the outcomes of these activities will build up the knowledge base and develop solutions to fill the significant innovation gap faced worldwide.},

A change in register of the cysteines and alanines of the sequence from the periplasmic mercury?binding protein, MerP, i.e., CAAC, CACA, and CCAA, affects the specificity of metal binding, in particular, the peptide with vicinal cysteines binds only mercury. The three?dimensional structures of the mercury?bound forms of the three peptides determined in solution by NMR spectroscopy peptides differ considerably, even though they are all linear bicoordinate complexes. The three?dimensional structure of the peptide with CAAC bound to Cd(II) demonstrates that the metal?binding loop is malleable enough to accommodate modes of coordination other than linear bicoordinate. ? 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Though the photoactivity of ``ZnS-shell'' was higher than that of coprecipitated ZnS, their photoactivity under visible light conditions was low. However, the ``Cu-ZnS-shell'' was active to light of wavelengths higher than 440 nm and is preferred over CdS, which requires an expensive support metal catalyst such as platinum to decompose HS- ion.},

  abstract = {Sulfur and sulfur compounds can produce pitting, crevice corrosion, dealloying, stress corrosion cracking, and stress-oriented hydrogen-induced cracking of susceptible metals and alloys. Even though the metabolic by-products of the biological sulfur cycle are extremely corrosive, there are no correlations between numbers and types of sulfur-related organisms and the probability or rate of corrosion. Determination of specific mechanisms for corrosion caused by microbiologically mediated oxidation and reduction of sulfur and sulfur compounds is complicated by the variety of potential metabolic/energy sources and by-products; the coexistence of reduced and oxidized sulfur species; competing reactions with inorganic and organic compounds; and the versatility and adaptability of microorganisms in biofilms. The microbial ecology of sulfur-rich environments is poorly understood because of the association of aerobes and anaerobes and the mutualism or succession of heterotrophs to autotrophs. The physical scale over which the sulfur cycle influences corrosion varies with the environment. The complete sulfur cycle of oxidation and reduction reactions can take place in macroenvironments, including sewers and polluted harbors, or within the microenvironment of biofilms. In this review, reactions of sulfur and sulfur compounds resulting in corrosion were discussed in the context of environmental processes important to corrosion.},

  abstract = {Heavy metal pollution has become one of the most serious environmental problems today. Biosorption, using biomaterials such as bacteria, fungi, yeast and algae, is regarded as a cost-effective biotechnology for the treatment of high volume and low concentration complex wastewaters containing heavy metal(s) in the order of 1 to 100~mg/L. Among the promising biosorbents for heavy metal removal which have been researched during the past decades, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has received increasing attention due to the unique nature in spite of its mediocre capacity for metal uptake compared with other fungi. S. cerevisiae is widely used in food and beverage production, is easily cultivated using cheap media, is also a by-product in large quantity as a waste of the fermentation industry, and is easily manipulated at molecular level. The state of the art in the field of biosorption of heavy metals by S. cerevisiae not only in China, but also worldwide, is reviewed in this paper, based on a substantial number of relevant references published recently on the background of biosorption achievements and development. Characteristics of S. cerevisiae in heavy metal biosorption are extensively discussed. The yeast can be studied in various forms for different purposes. Metal-binding capacity for various heavy metals by S. cerevisiae under different conditions is compared. Lead and uranium, for instances, could be removed from dilute solutions more effectively in comparison with other metals. The yeast biosorption largely depends on parameters such as pH, the ratio of the initial metal ion and initial biomass concentration, culture conditions, presence of various ligands and competitive metal ions in solution and to a limited extent on temperature. An assessment of the isotherm equilibrium model, as well as kinetics was performed. The mechanisms of biosorption are understood only to a limited extent. Elucidation of the mechanism of metal uptake is a real challenge in the field of biosorption. Various mechanism assumptions of metal uptake by S. cerevisiae are summarized.},

  shorttitle = {Athabasca Oil Sands},
  abstract = {The Canadian oil sands deposits in northern Alberta contain about 1.3 trillion barrels of crude oil equivalent. The largest of the four major formations is found in the Athabasca region where bitumen is heterogeneously distributed throughout an unconsolidated mineral matrix. About one-tenth of the oil sands in this deposit is economically recoverable by conventional surface mining techniques. The Hot Water Extraction Process (HWEP) is used commercially to recover bitumen from surface mined oil sands ore. The viability of this process relies on the existence of a thin water film around each solid particle in the ore matrix. However, a completely water-wet mineral condition is not generally the case for oil reservoirs, including oil sands deposits. In the latter case, it has been shown that certain solid fractions are associated with significant amounts of toluene insoluble organic matter (TIOM), physically or chemically adsorbed onto particle surfaces. These fractions are generically described as `organic rich solids' (ORS). In bitumen separation processes, the organic matter associated with various ORS fractions represents an impediment to optimum bitumen separation and upgrading. In this sense, these solids are considered to be `active' relative to the `inactive' water wetted quartz particles comprising the bulk of the oil sands ore. Preliminary results indicate that the ORS content of an ore appears to be a better predictor for ore processability than the traditional use of bitumen or fines (-44 {$\mu$}m) contents. Two types of ORS have received particular attention. The first is a coarser fraction, usually less than 44 {$\mu$}m but also occurring as particles greater than 100 {$\mu$}m in diameter. This material typically occurs as aggregates of smaller particles bound together by humic matter and precipitated minerals. During the bitumen separation process, these heavy aggregates carry any associated bitumen into the aqueous tailings, thus reducing overall bitumen recovery. The second important fraction comprises very thin, ultra-fine clay particles with a major dimension of {$<$}0.3 {$\mu$}m. These ultra-fine clays, with a surface coating of organic matter, remain with bitumen during the separation process. In bitumen upgrading, these solids may be entrained with volatile overheads and cause problems in downstream operations. This paper summarises the protocols developed to separate and characterise these intractable components from HWEP process streams and discusses their role in determining bitumen recovery and quality.},

In the 2008 snowpack, all PPE except selenium were greater near oil sands developments than at more remote sites. Bitumen upgraders and local oil sands development were sources of airborne emissions. Concentrations of mercury, nickel, and thallium in winter and all 13 PPE in summer were greater in tributaries with watersheds more disturbed by development than in less disturbed watersheds. In the Athabasca River during summer, concentrations of all PPE were greater near developed areas than upstream of development. At sites downstream of development and within the Athabasca Delta, concentrations of all PPE except beryllium and selenium remained greater than upstream of development. Concentrations of some PPE at one location in Lake Athabasca near Fort Chipewyan were also greater than concentration in the Athabasca River upstream of development.

  abstract = {Acid mine drainage (AMD) causes environmental pollution that affects many countries having historic or current mining industries. Preventing the formation or the migration of AMD from its source is generally considered to be the preferable option, although this is not feasible in many locations, and in such cases, it is necessary to collect, treat, and discharge mine water. There are various options available for remediating AMD, which may be divided into those that use either chemical or biological mechanisms to neutralise AMD and remove metals from solution. Both abiotic and biological systems include those that are classed as ``active'' (i.e., require continuous inputs of resources to sustain the process) or ``passive'' (i.e., require relatively little resource input once in operation). This review describes the current abiotic and bioremediative strategies that are currently used to mitigate AMD and compares the strengths and weaknesses of each. New and emerging technologies are also described. In addition, the factors that currently influence the selection of a remediation system, and how these criteria may change in the future, are discussed.},

Excess concentrations of heavy metals have adverse effects on plant metabolic activities hence affect the food production, quantitatively and qualitatively. Heavy metal when reaches human tissues through various absorption pathways such as direct ingestion, dermal contact, diet through the soil\textendash{}food chain, inhalation and oral intake may seriously affect their health. Therefore, several management practices are being applied to minimize metal toxicity by attenuating the availability of metal to the plants. Some of the traditional methods are either extremely costly or they are simply applied to isolate contaminated site. The biology-based technology like use of hypermetal accumulator plants occurring naturally or created by transgenic technology, in recent years draws great attention to remediate heavy metal contamination. Recently, applications of nanoparticle for metal remediation are also attracting great research interest due to their exceptional adsorption and mechanical properties and unique electrical property, highly chemical stability, and large specific surface area. Thus, the present review deals with different management approaches to reduce level of metal contamination in soil and finally to the food chain.},

  abstract = {China produces and consumes a large amount of batteries annually, which leads to many waste batteries needing to be recycled. The collection and recycling system of primary, alkaline secondary, and lithium-ion secondary batteries in China is particularly poor, and waste battery recycling enterprises generally sustain economic losses if they solely use waste batteries as raw materials. Increasing the profits of waste battery recycling systems is a key problem that needs to be considered. This article quantitatively analyzes waste battery generation in China by using annual sales data and probable lifetime distribution of various batteries. The results show that the rapid growth of battery usage has led to an increased generation of waste batteries and the percentage of different types of waste batteries is changing over time. In 2013, the total quantity of all waste batteries in the medium lifetime scenario reached 570 kilotons, of which primary, alkaline secondary, and lithium-ion secondary waste batteries accounted for approximately 36\%, 28\%, and 35\%, respectively. Based on a real-world case study of a typical domestic waste battery recycling enterprise in China, material flow analysis and cost-benefit analysis were conducted to study the development of the recycling process of comingled waste batteries. Through scenario analysis, we conclude that increasing the use of waste batteries as raw materials and the recycling of other materials that are less valuable reduces the profits of the waste battery recycling enterprise. Higher profits can be achieved by adding the production of high value-added downstream products and government support. At the same time, the essential role of the government in developing a waste battery recycling system was identified. Finally, relevant suggestions are made for improvements in both the government and enterprise sectors.},

  abstract = {The aim of this work was to implement experimentally a simple glucose-limited feeding strategy for yeast biomass production in a bubble column reactor based on a spreadsheet simulator suitable for industrial application. In biomass production process using Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, one of the constraints is the strong tendency of these species to metabolize sugars anaerobically due to catabolite repression, leading to low values of biomass yield on substrate. The usual strategy to control this metabolic tendency is the use of a fed-batch process in which where the sugar source is fed incrementally and total sugar concentration in broth is maintained below a determined value. The simulator presented in this work was developed to control molasses feeding on the basis of a simple theoretical model in which has taken into account the nutritional growth needs of yeast cell and two input data: the theoretical specific growth rate and initial cell biomass. In experimental assay, a commercial baker's yeast strain and molasses as sugar source were used. Experimental results showed an overall biomass yield on substrate of 0.33, a biomass increase of 6.4 fold and a specific growth rate of 0.165 h-1 in contrast to the predicted value of 0.180 h-1 in the second stage simulation.},

  abstract = {The specific growth rate is a key control parameter in the industrial production of baker's yeast. Nevertheless, quantitative data describing its effect on fermentative capacity are not available from the literature. In this study, the effect of the specific growth rate on the physiology and fermentative capacity of an industrialSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain in aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat cultures was investigated. At specific growth rates (dilution rates, D) below 0.28 h-1, glucose metabolism was fully respiratory. Above this dilution rate, respirofermentative metabolism set in, with ethanol production rates of up to 14 mmol of ethanol {$\cdot$} g of biomass-1 {$\cdot$} h-1at D = 0.40 h-1. A substantial fermentative capacity (assayed offline as ethanol production rate under anaerobic conditions) was found in cultures in which no ethanol was detectable (D {$<$} 0.28 h-1). This fermentative capacity increased with increasing dilution rates, from 10.0 mmol of ethanol {$\cdot$} g of dry yeast biomass-1 {$\cdot$} h-1 at D= 0.025 h-1 to 20.5 mmol of ethanol {$\cdot$} g of dry yeast biomass-1 {$\cdot$} h-1 atD = 0.28 h-1. At even higher dilution rates, the fermentative capacity showed only a small further increase, up to 22.0 mmol of ethanol {$\cdot$} g of dry yeast biomass-1 {$\cdot$} h-1 at D= 0.40 h-1. The activities of all glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate decarboxylase, and alcohol dehydrogenase were determined in cell extracts. Only the in vitro activities of pyruvate decarboxylase and phosphofructokinase showed a clear positive correlation with fermentative capacity. These enzymes are interesting targets for overexpression in attempts to improve the fermentative capacity of aerobic cultures grown at low specific growth rates.},

  abstract = {Sedimentary iron sulfide minerals play a key role in maintaining the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere over geological timescales; they also record critical geochemical information that can be used to reconstruct paleo-environments. On modern Earth, sedimentary iron sulfide mineral formation takes places in low-temperature environments and requires the production of free sulfide by sulfate-reducing microorganisms (SRM) under anoxic conditions. Yet, most of our knowledge on the properties and formation pathways of iron sulfide minerals, including pyrite, derives from experimental studies performed in abiotic conditions, and as such the role of biotic processes in the formation of sedimentary iron sulfide minerals is poorly understood. Here we investigate the role of SRM in the nucleation and growth of iron sulfide minerals in laboratory experiments. We set out to test the hypothesis that SRM can influence Fe-S mineralization in ways other than providing sulfide through the comparison of the physical properties of iron sulfide minerals precipitated in the presence and in the absence of the sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio hydrothermalis AM13 under well-controlled conditions. X-ray diffraction and microscopy analyses reveal that iron sulfide minerals produced in the presence of SRM exhibit unique morphology and aggregate differently than abiotic minerals formed in media without cells. Specifically, mackinawite growth is favored in the presence of both live and dead SRM, when compared to the abiotic treatments tested. The cell surface of live and dead SRM, and the extracellular polymers produced by live cells, provide templates for the nucleation of mackinawite and favor mineral growth. The morphology of minerals is however different when live and dead cells are provided. The transformation of greigite from mackinawite occurred after several months of incubation only in the presence of live SRM, suggesting that SRM might accelerate the kinetics of greigite formation under strict anoxic conditions. Pyrite formation was not observed in any experiments. While SRM provide nearly all the sulfide to the Fe-S system at low temperatures, we also posit that SRM play an additional formative role in the size, morphology and potentially the mineralogy of iron sulfide minerals in sedimentary environments, therefore potentially influencing their reactivity. Attempting to reconstruct modern and ancient biogeochemical cycles based on the geochemistry of iron sulfide minerals formed under purely abiotic conditions should be therefore done with caution.},

These chimneys are dynamic environments occupied by a diversity of microbes whose distribution is typically concordant with mineralogy and temperature. Recent studies indicate that these chimney assemblages are conductive and present the possibility that microbial extracellular electron transfer may occur through these minerals, linking spatially separated electron donors and acceptors. Here we explore the relationships among biology, mineralogy, and electric potential in hydrothermal systems using crushed hydrothermal chimney as inoculum in high (75 \textdegree{}C) and low (30 \textdegree{}C) temperature bioelectrical systems. All experiments with live microbial communities incubated in the presence of a poised electrode resulted in enhanced mineral deposition relative to (A) a live, open circuit (not poised) electrode, or (B) dead microbial communities in the presence of a poised electrode. Microbial abundance increased in both high- and low-temperature treatments, dominated by taxa allied to the Deferribacterales on the high-temperature treatment electrode, and Chromatiales and Campylobacterales on the low-temperature treatment electrodes. Here we discuss the results of these experiments and consider the implications of these observations for the role that microorganisms may play in the formation of metal-rich hydrothermal chimneys.},

  abstract = {This report provides the most comprehensive overview of global e-waste statistics following the guidelines that were developed by the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development1. All the countries in the world combined generated a staggering 44.7 million metric tonnes (Mt), or an equivalent of 6.1 kilogram per inhabitant (kg/inh), of e-waste annually in 2016, compared to the 5.8 kg/inh generated in 2014. This is close to 4,500 Eiffel Towers each year. The amount of e-waste is expected to increase to 52.2 million metric tonnes, or 6.8 kg/inh, by 2021.},
