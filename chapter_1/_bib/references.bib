  shorttitle = {Glucose and Insulin Responses to Dietary Chromium Supplements},
  abstract = {Background: Several authors, mostly on the basis of nonrandomized studies, have suggested dietary trivalent chromium supplementation as an attractive option for the management of type 2 diabetes and for glycemic control in persons at high risk of type 2 diabetes.
Objective: The study aimed to determine the effect of chromium on glucose and insulin responses in healthy subjects and in individuals with glucose intolerance or type 2 diabetes.
Design: The study design was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs).
Results: The authors identified 20 reports of RCTs assessing the effect of chromium on glucose, insulin, or glycated hemoglobin (Hb A1c). This review summarizes data on 618 participants from the 15 trials that reported adequate data: 193 participants had type 2 diabetes and 425 were in good health or had impaired glucose tolerance. The meta-analysis showed no association between chromium and glucose or insulin concentrations among nondiabetic subjects. A study of 155 diabetic subjects in China showed that chromium reduced glucose and insulin concentrations; the combined data from the 38 diabetic subjects in the other studies did not. Three trials reported data on Hb A1c: one study each of persons with type 2 diabetes, persons with impaired glucose tolerance, and healthy subjects. The study of diabetic subjects in China was the only one to report that chromium significantly reduced Hb A1c.
Conclusions: Data from RCTs show no effect of chromium on glucose or insulin concentrations in nondiabetic subjects. The data for persons with diabetes are inconclusive. RCTs in well-characterized, at-risk populations are necessary to determine the effects of chromium on glucose, insulin, and Hb A1c.},

  abstract = {Heavy metal pollution has become one of the most serious environmental problems today. The treatment of heavy metals is of special concern due to their recalcitrance and persistence in the environment. In recent years, various methods for heavy metal removal from wastewater have been extensively studied. This paper reviews the current methods that have been used to treat heavy metal wastewater and evaluates these techniques. These technologies include chemical precipitation, ion-exchange, adsorption, membrane filtration, coagulation–flocculation, flotation and electrochemical methods. About 185 published studies (1988–2010) are reviewed in this paper. It is evident from the literature survey articles that ion-exchange, adsorption and membrane filtration are the most frequently studied for the treatment of heavy metal wastewater.},

Yeasts cannot grow anaerobically, and so require oxygen. All wild-type yeasts utilize glucose, man-nose, and fructose. Different species may also utilize numerous other sugars and organic acids. Some yeasts can utilize nitrates, others only ammonium salts. They can utilize a wide range of organic nitrogen compounds, including both L- and D-amino acids (LaRue and Spencer 1966). All yeasts require trace elements. Some species can synthesize the growth factors they require, and many cannot, and these must be supplied. Cyniclomyces guttulatus probably requires the most amino acids and vitamins, and an atmosphere high in Co2, (10–15\%); its normal habitat is the cecum of the rabbit, and it is not easy to cultivate in the laboratory.},

  abstract = {Yeast extract was produced from brewer's yeast of a beer factory by combined enzymatic treatments using endoprotease, exoprotease, 5′-phosphodiesterase, and adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-deaminase. Effects of enzyme combination, enzyme dosages and treatment sequence on the recovery of solid and protein, flavor and compositional characteristics were investigated. Exoprotease dosage strongly affected the recovery of protein and degree of hydrolysis (DH) and sensory characteristics. When the yeast cells were treated using optimal combination of endoprotease and exoprotease (0.6\% ProtamexTM and 0.6\% FlavourzymeTM), high solid recovery (48.3–53.1\%) and the best flavor profile were obtained. Among various treatment sequences using multiple enzymes, treatment with protease followed by nuclease resulted in the highest 5′-guanosine monophosphate (5′-GMP) content. The optimal concentrations of both 5′-phosphodiesterase and AMP-deaminase were found to be 0.03\%. After treatments using optimal combination of enzyme, enzyme dosages and treatment sequence for four enzymes, a high solid yield of 55.1\% and 5′-nucleotides content of 3.67\% were obtained.},

In an attempt to extrapolate the heavy metal hyperaccumulating phenotype to yeast, we obtained Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells armed with non-natural metal-binding hexapeptides targeted to the inner face of the plasma membrane, expected to sequester the metal ions once they penetrated the cell. We describe the construction of S. cerevisiae strains overexpressing metal-binding hexapeptides (MeBHxP) fused to the carboxy-terminus of a myristoylated green fluorescent protein (myrGFP). Three non-toxic myrGFP-MeBHxP (myrGFP-H6, myrGFP-C6, and myrGFP-(DE)3) were investigated against an array of heavy metals in terms of their effect on S. cerevisiae growth, heavy metal (hyper) accumulation, and capacity to remove heavy metal from contaminated environments.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the technical applicability of various physico–chemical treatments for the removal of heavy metals such as Cd(II), Cr(III), Cr(VI), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) from contaminated wastewater. A particular focus is given to chemical precipitation, coagulation–flocculation, flotation, ion exchange and membrane filtration. Their advantages and limitations in application are evaluated. Their operating conditions such as pH, dose required, initial metal concentration and treatment performance are presented. About 124 published studies (1980–2006) are reviewed. It is evident from the survey that ion exchange and membrane filtration are the most frequently studied and widely applied for the treatment of metal-contaminated wastewater. Ion exchange has achieved a complete removal of Cd(II), Cr(III), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) with an initial concentration of 100mg/L, respectively. The results are comparable to that of reverse osmosis (99\% of Cd(II) rejection with an initial concentration of 200mg/L). Lime precipitation has been found as one of the most effective means to treat inorganic effluent with a metal concentration of higher than 1000mg/L. It is important to note that the overall treatment cost of metal-contaminated water varies, depending on the process employed and the local conditions. In general, the technical applicability, plant simplicity and cost-effectiveness are the key factors in selecting the most suitable treatment for inorganic effluent.},

  abstract = {Water treatment infrastructure faces numerous operational and financial challenges in most regions of the world. Ion exchange is a water treatment technology that can be used to remove various contaminants in drinking water and has shown increased adoption in recent years due to its operational advantages; however, limited research has been conducted on the environmental and economic sustainability of ion exchange systems. This study utilizes life cycle assessment and cost analysis to holistically evaluate environmental and economic impacts of ion exchange technology that is used for reduction of disinfection by-products via organics removal in eight drinking water treatment plants in Florida. A functional unit accounting for both water quantity and quality was used and showed to have a significant effect on the evaluation results. Impact assessment results show that the construction phase has negligible environmental impact in comparison to the operation phase. Systems that use fixed bed reactors with conventional resin were compared with systems using completely mixed flow reactors with magnetic ion exchange resin. Fixed bed systems evaluated have higher salt usage and brine waste production, but use less electricity, resin, and require less transport of materials. This tradeoff causes fixed bed systems to have a higher environmental impact in categories of eutrophication, carcinogenics, non-carcinogenics, and ecotoxicity but lower impact in other categories. Furthermore, it causes fixed bed systems to have a lower operation cost compared with completely mixed systems. Results also show that both environmental impacts and operation costs per functional unit decrease with scale, similar to economies of scale effects.},

  abstract = {Although promising for biomimetic materials applications, polypeptides binding inorganic material surfaces and the mechanism of their function have been difficult to characterize. This paper reports sequence–activity relationships of peptides interfacing with semiconductor CdS, and presents methodologies broadly applicable to studying peptide–solid surface interactions. We first employed yeast surface display with a human repertoire antibody library and identified rarely-occurring scFv fragments as CdS-binding polypeptides. Using our semi-quantitative cell-surface binding assay, site-directed mutational analysis, and genetic engineering we defined short distal regions of the displayed polypeptides necessary and sufficient for CdS binding. Alanine scanning mutagenesis in combination with a series of engineered polyhistidine peptides elucidated a direct relationship between histidine number and binding strength, which appeared to be further modulated by arginine and basic residues. The minimum strength of interaction was established by competition studies using soluble synthetic peptide analogs, which showed half-maximal inhibition of yeast binding to CdS at ∼2μM peptide. We then showed the ability of cells displaying material-specific polypeptides to form self-healing biofilms and discriminate between materials of fabricated heterostructure surfaces. Furthermore, we demonstrated the synthetic potential of the selected soluble CdS peptide in mediating aqueous synthesis of fluorescent CdS nanoparticles at room temperature. This platform may be further applied to elucidate mechanisms governing interfacial interactions and to generate material-specific reagents useful in medicine, biosensors, and bioproduction of high value inorganic materials.},

  abstract = {Production of recombinant proteins for use as pharmaceuticals, so-called biopharmaceuticals, is a multi-billion dollar industry. Many different cell factories are used for the production of biopharmaceuticals, but the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important cell factory as it is used for production of several large volume products. Insulin and insulin analogs are by far the dominating biopharmaceuticals produced by yeast, and this will increase as the global insulin market is expected to grow from USD12B in 2011 to more than USD32B by 2018. Other important biopharmaceuticals produced by yeast are human serum albumin, hepatitis vaccines and virus like particles used for vaccination against human papillomavirus. Here is given a brief overview of biopharmaceutical production by yeast and it is discussed how the secretory pathway can be engineered to ensure more efficient protein production. The involvement of directed metabolic engineering through the integration of tools from genetic engineering, systems biology and mathematical modeling, is also discussed.},
