  abstract = {Many plasma membrane proteins in yeast are ubiquitinated and endocytosed, but how they are recognized for modification has remained unknown. Here, we show that the manganese transporter Smf1 is endocytosed when cells are exposed to cadmium ions, that this endocytosis depends on Rsp5-dependent ubiquitination of specific lysines and that it also requires phosphorylation at nearby sites. This phosphorylation is, however, constitutive rather than stress-induced. Efficient ubiquitination requires Ecm21 or Csr2, two members of a family of arrestin-like yeast proteins that contain several PY motifs and bind to Rsp5. Ecm21 also binds to phosphorylated Smf1, providing a link between Rsp5 and its substrate. PY motif-containing arrestin-like proteins are found in many species, including humans, and might have a general role as ubiquitin ligase adaptors.

  abstract = {The exceptional toxicity of arsenate [As(V)] is derived from its close chemical similarity to phosphate (Pi), which allows the metalloid to be easily incorporated into plant cells through the high-affinity Pi transport system. In this study, we identified an As(V)-tolerant mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana named pht1;1-3, which harbors a semidominant allele coding for the high-affinity Pi transporter PHT1;1. pht1;1-3 displays a slow rate of As(V) uptake that ultimately enables the mutant to accumulate double the arsenic found in wild-type plants. Overexpression of the mutant protein in wild-type plants provokes phenotypic effects similar to pht1;1-3 with regard to As(V) uptake and accumulation. In addition, gene expression analysis of wild-type and mutant plants revealed that, in Arabidopsis, As(V) represses the activation of genes specifically involved in Pi uptake, while inducing others transcriptionally regulated by As(V), suggesting that converse signaling pathways are involved in plant responses to As(V) and low Pi availability. Furthermore, the repression effect of As(V) on Pi starvation responses may reflect a regulatory mechanism to protect plants from the extreme toxicity of arsenic.},

  abstract = {Chromate is a widespread pollutant as a waste of human activities. However, the mechanisms underlying its high toxicity are not clearly understood. In this work, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to analyse the physiological effects of chromate exposure in a eukaryote cell model. We show that chromate causes a strong decrease of sulfate assimilation and sulfur metabolite pools suggesting that cells experience sulfur starvation. As a consequence, nearly all enzymes of the sulfur pathway are highly induced as well as enzymes of the sulfur-sparing response such as Pdc6, the sulfur-poor pyruvate decarboxylase. The induction of Pdc6 was regulated at the mRNA level and dependent upon Met32, a coactivator of Met4, the transcriptional activator of the sulfur pathway. Finally, we found that chromate enters the cells mainly through sulfate transporters and competitively inhibits sulfate uptake. Also consistent with a competition between the two substrates, sulfate supplementation relieves chromate toxicity. However, the data suggest that the chromate-mediated sulfur depletion is not simply due to this competitive uptake but would also be the consequence of competitive metabolism between the two compounds presumably at another step of the sulfur assimilation pathway.},

  abstract = {The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SMF1gene encodes a member of the well conserved family of Nramp metal transport proteins. Previously, we determined that heavy metal uptake by Smf1p was down-regulated by the product of the S. cerevisiae BSD2 gene. We now demonstrate that this regulation occurs at the level of protein stability. In wild type strains, the bulk of Smf1p is normally directed to the vacuole and is rapidly degraded by vacuolar proteases in a PEP4-dependent manner. Inbsd2{$\Delta$} mutants, Smf1p fails to enter the vacuole, and the Nramp protein is stabilized. Metal ions themselves play an important role in the post-translational regulation of Smf1p. The depletion of heavy metals from the growth medium effects stabilization of Smf1p and additionally results in accumulation of this transporter at the cell surface. Supplementation of manganese alone is sufficient to trigger rapid degradation of Smf1p in a Bsd2p-dependent manner. Together the action of Bsd2p and metal ions provide a rapid and effective means for controlling Nramp metal transport in response to environmental changes.},

By screening for plant genes mediating metal tolerance we identified a wheat cDNA, TaPCS1, whose expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in a dramatic increase in cadmium tolerance. TaPCS1 encodes a protein of {$\sim$}55 kDa with no similarity to proteins of known function. We identified homologs of this new gene family from Arabidopsis thaliana, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and interestingly also Caenorhabditis elegans. The Arabidopsis and S.pombe genes were also demonstrated to confer substantial increases in metal tolerance in yeast. PCS-expressing cells accumulate more Cd2+ than controls. PCS expression mediates Cd2+ tolerance even in yeast mutants that are either deficient in vacuolar acidification or impaired in vacuolar biogenesis. PCS-induced metal resistance is lost upon exposure to an inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis, a process necessary for phytochelatin formation. Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells disrupted in the PCS gene exhibit hypersensitivity to Cd2+ and Cu2+ and are unable to synthesize phytochelatins upon Cd2+ exposure as determined by HPLC analysis. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells expressing PCS produce phytochelatins. Moreover, the recombinant purified S.pombe PCS protein displays phytochelatin synthase activity. These data demonstrate that PCS genes encode phytochelatin synthases and mediate metal detoxification in eukaryotes.},

How Al enters cells has not been elucidated in any organisms. Herein, we report a transporter, Nrat1 (Nramp aluminum transporter 1), specific for trivalent Al ion in rice. Nrat1 belongs to the Nramp (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein) family, but shares a low similarity with other Nramp members. When expressed in yeast, Nrat1 transports trivalent Al ion, but not other divalent ions, such as manganese, iron, and cadmium, or the Al\textendash{}citrate complex. Nrat1 is localized at the plasma membranes of all cells of root tips except epidermal cells. Knockout of Nrat1 resulted in decreased Al uptake, increased Al binding to cell wall, and enhanced Al sensitivity, but did not affect the tolerance to other metals. Expression of Nrat1 is up-regulated by Al in the roots and regulated by a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor (ART1). We therefore concluded that Nrat1 is a plasma membrane-localized transporter for trivalent Al, which is required for a prior step of final Al detoxification through sequestration of Al into vacuoles.},

  abstract = {Summary
The widely conserved natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (Nramp) family of divalent metal transporters enables manganese import in bacteria and dietary iron uptake in mammals. We determined the crystal structure of the Deinococcus radiodurans Nramp homolog (DraNramp) in an inward-facing apo state, including the complete transmembrane (TM) segment 1a (absent from a previous Nramp structure). Mapping our cysteine accessibility scanning results onto this structure, we identified the metal-permeation pathway in the alternate outward-open conformation. We investigated the functional impact of two natural anemia-causing glycine-to-arginine mutations that impaired transition metal transport in both human Nramp2 and DraNramp. The TM4 G153R mutation perturbs the closing of the outward metal-permeation pathway and alters the selectivity of the conserved metal-binding site. In contrast, the~TM1a G45R mutation prevents conformational change by sterically blocking the essential movement of that helix, thus locking the transporter in an inward-facing state.},

A particular focus is given to chemical precipitation, coagulation\textendash{}flocculation, flotation, ion exchange and membrane filtration. Their advantages and limitations in application are evaluated. Their operating conditions such as pH, dose required, initial metal concentration and treatment performance are presented. About 124 published studies (1980\textendash{}2006) are reviewed. It is evident from the survey that ion exchange and membrane filtration are the most frequently studied and widely applied for the treatment of metal-contaminated wastewater. Ion exchange has achieved a complete removal of Cd(II), Cr(III), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) with an initial concentration of 100mg/L, respectively. The results are comparable to that of reverse osmosis (99\% of Cd(II) rejection with an initial concentration of 200mg/L). Lime precipitation has been found as one of the most effective means to treat inorganic effluent with a metal concentration of higher than 1000mg/L. It is important to note that the overall treatment cost of metal-contaminated water varies, depending on the process employed and the local conditions. In general, the technical applicability, plant simplicity and cost-effectiveness are the key factors in selecting the most suitable treatment for inorganic effluent.},

  abstract = {All eukaryotes and most prokaryotes require transition metals. In recent years there has been an enormous advance in our understanding of how these metals are transported across the plasma membrane. Much of this understanding has resulted from studies on the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A variety of genetic and biochemical approaches have led to a detailed understanding of how transition metals such as iron, copper, manganese, and zinc are acquired by cells. The regulation of metal transport has been defined at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. Results from studies on S. cerevisiae have been used to understand metal transport in other species of yeast as well as in higher eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {Members of the SLC11 (NRAMP) family transport iron and other transition-metal ions across cellular membranes. These membrane proteins are present in all kingdoms of life with a high degree of sequence conservation. To gain insight into the determinants of ion selectivity, we have determined the crystal structure of Staphylococcus capitis DMT (ScaDMT), a close prokaryotic homolog of the family. ScaDMT shows a familiar architecture that was previously identified in the amino acid permease LeuT. The protein adopts an inward-facing conformation with a substrate-binding site located in the center of the transporter. This site is composed of conserved residues, which coordinate Mn2+, Fe2+ and Cd2+ but not Ca2+. Mutations of interacting residues affect ion binding and transport in both ScaDMT and human DMT1. Our study thus reveals a conserved mechanism for transition-metal ion selectivity within the SLC11 family.},

  abstract = {Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (Nramp) family transporters catalyze uptake of essential divalent transition metals like iron and manganese. To discriminate against abundant competitors, the Nramp metal-binding site should favor softer transition metals, which interact either covalently or ionically with coordinating molecules, over hard calcium and magnesium, which interact mainly ionically. The metal-binding site contains an unusual, but conserved, methionine, and its sulfur coordinates transition metal substrates, suggesting a vital role in their transport. Using a bacterial Nramp model system, we show that, surprisingly, this conserved methionine is dispensable for transport of the physiological manganese substrate and similar divalents iron and cobalt, with several small amino acid replacements still enabling robust uptake. Moreover, the methionine sulfur's presence makes the toxic metal cadmium a preferred substrate. However, a methionine-to-alanine substitution enables transport of calcium and magnesium. Thus, the putative evolutionary pressure to maintain the Nramp metal-binding methionine likely exists because it\textemdash{}more effectively than any other amino acid\textemdash{}increases selectivity for low-abundance transition metal transport in the presence of high-abundance divalents like calcium and magnesium.},

  abstract = {Metal ions such as copper and manganese represent a unique problem to living cells in that these ions are not only essential co-factors for metalloproteins, but are also potentially toxic. To aid in the homeostatic balance of essential but toxic metals, cells have evolved with a complex network of metal trafficking pathways. The object of such pathways is two-fold: to prevent accumulation of the metal in the freely reactive form (metal detoxification pathways) and to ensure proper delivery of the ion to target metalloproteins (metal utilization pathways). Much of what we currently know regarding these complex pathways of metal trafficking has emerged from molecular genetic studies in baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this review, we shall briefly highlight the current understanding of factors that function in the trafficking and handling of copper, including copper detoxification factors, copper transporters and copper chaperones. In addition, very recent findings on the players involved in manganese trafficking will be presented. The goal is to provide a paradigm for the intracellular handling of metals that may be applied in a more general sense to metals that serve essential functions in biology.},

  abstract = {The issue of heavy metal pollution is very much concerned because of their toxicity for plant, animal and human beings and their lack of biodegradability. Excess concentrations of heavy metals have adverse effects on plant metabolic activities hence affect the food production, quantitatively and qualitatively. Heavy metal when reaches human tissues through various absorption pathways such as direct ingestion, dermal contact, diet through the soil\textendash{}food chain, inhalation and oral intake may seriously affect their health. Therefore, several management practices are being applied to minimize metal toxicity by attenuating the availability of metal to the plants. Some of the traditional methods are either extremely costly or they are simply applied to isolate contaminated site. The biology-based technology like use of hypermetal accumulator plants occurring naturally or created by transgenic technology, in recent years draws great attention to remediate heavy metal contamination. Recently, applications of nanoparticle for metal remediation are also attracting great research interest due to their exceptional adsorption and mechanical properties and unique electrical property, highly chemical stability, and large specific surface area. Thus, the present review deals with different management approaches to reduce level of metal contamination in soil and finally to the food chain.},

The release of dyes into the environment constitutes only a small proportion of water pollution, but dyes are visible in small quantities due to their brilliance. Tightening government legislation is forcing textile industries to treat their waste effluent to an increasingly high standard. Currently, removal of dyes from effluents is by physio-chemical means. Such methods are often very costly and although the dyes are removed, accumulation of concentrated sludge creates a disposal problem. There is a need to find alternative treatments that are effective in removing dyes from large volumes of effluents and are low in cost, such as biological or combination systems. This article reviews the current available technologies and suggests an effective, cheaper alternative for dye removal and decolourisation applicable on large scale.},

However, in case of 137Cs, about 44\% could be removed from solutions (5\texttimes{}103kBql-1) at the end of 168h of incubation. Accumulation of 90Sr and 137Cs was higher in roots compared to shoots. The plants could remediate both 90Sr and 137Cs when they were added together to the solution. When two months old plants were incubated in low level nuclear waste, 99\% of activity disappeared at the end of 15 days.

We demonstrate here thatbsd2 mutant cells additionally accumulate high levels of cadmium and cobalt. By biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy, BSD2 exhibited localization to the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that BSD2 acts at a distance to inhibit metal uptake from the growth medium. This BSD2 control of ion transport occurs independently of the CTR1 and FET4 metal transport systems. Genetic suppressor analysis revealed that hyperaccumulation of copper and cadmium in bsd2 mutants is mediated throughSMF1, previously shown to encode a plasma membrane transporter for manganese. A nonsense mutation removing the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain of SMF1 was found to mimic asmf1 gene deletion by eliminating the copper and cadmium toxicity of bsd2 mutants and also by precluding thebsd2 suppression of superoxide dismutase deficiency. However, inactivation of SMF1 did not eliminate the elevated cobalt levels in bsd2 mutants. Instead, this cobalt accumulation was found to be specifically mediated through theSMF1 homologue, SMF2. Hence, BSD2 prevents metal hyperaccumulation by exerting negative control over the SMF1 and SMF2 metal transport systems.},

Phenotypic analyses of animals with spontaneous mutations in DMT1 indicate that it functions at two distinct sites, transporting dietary iron across the apical membrane of intestinal absorptive cells, and transporting endosomal iron released from transferrin into the cytoplasm of erythroid precursors. DMT1 also acts as a proton-dependent transporter for other heavy metal ions including Mn2+, Co2+, and Cu2, but not for Mg2+ or Ca2+. A unique mutation in DMT1, G185R, has occurred spontaneously on two occasions in microcytic (mk) mice and once in Belgrade (b) rats. This mutation severely impairs the iron transport capability of DMT1, leading to systemic iron deficiency and anemia. The repeated occurrence of the G185R mutation cannot readily be explained by hypermutability of the gene. Here we show that G185R mutant DMT1 exhibits a new, constitutive Ca2+ permeability, suggesting a gain of function that contributes to remutation and the mk and b phenotypes.},

  abstract = {The radioactive fission product 90Sr has a long biological half-life (\texttildelow{}18 y) in the human body. Due to its chemical similarity to calcium it accumulates in bones and irradiates the bone marrow, causing its high radio-toxicity. Assessing 90Sr is therefore extremely important in case of a nuclear disaster. In this work 16 soil samples were collected from the exclusion zone ({$<$}30 km) of the earthquake-damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, to measure 90Sr activity concentration using liquid scintillation counting. 137Cs activity concentration was also measured with gamma-spectroscopy in order to investigate correlation with 90Sr. The 90Sr activity concentrations ranged from 3.0 {$\pm$} 0.3 to 23.3 {$\pm$} 1.5 Bq kg-1 while the 137Cs from 0.7 {$\pm$} 0.1 to 110.8 {$\pm$} 0.3 kBq kg-1. The fact that radioactive contamination originated from the Fukushima nuclear accident was obvious due to the presence of 134Cs. However, 90Sr contamination was not confirmed in all samples although detectable amounts of 90Sr can be expected in Japanese soils, as a background, stemming from global fallout due to the atmospheric nuclear weapon tests. Correlation analysis between 90Sr and 137Cs activity concentrations provides a potentially powerful tool to discriminate background 90Sr level from its Fukushima contribution.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the multivariate analysis of metal data in effluents, soil and groundwater to find the distribution and source identification of the selected metals in the three media. Samples were collected from three textile industries located in Hattar Industrial Estate, Pakistan. Metals were estimated by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The results showed elevated levels of Cr, Pb, Ni, Co, Fe, Ca, Na, K and Zn in these media, following the order: soil{$>$}effluent{$>$}water. Principle component analysis (PCA) of the data showed that the textile effluents are contaminating the soil wherein Cr and Pb were dominant toxic metals having concentrations of 5.96mg/kg and 4.46mg/kg, respectively. Other toxic metals such as Co, Cd, Zn, Ni, Mn and Fe, were found to have common origin in the textile effluents. The correlation study along with linear regression and PCA, supported the fact that various elevated metal concentrations emerged from the textile industrial effluents ultimately leading to contamination of the soil and groundwater in their proximity. The estimated metal levels in the water/soil system are compared with the safe limits laid down by WHO.},

  abstract = {Sedum alfredii Hance has been identified as a new zinc (Zn) hyperaccumulating plant species. In this study, the effects of cadmium (Cd) supply levels (control, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 {$\mu$}mol Cd L-1) on the growth and cadmium accumulation and Zn supply on Cd accumulation in S. alfredii Hance were studied. The results showed that no reduction in shoot and root dry matter yields were noted when the plants were grown at Cd supply levels up to 200 {$\mu$}mol L-1 in nutrient solution. Slight stimulation on shoot growth was noted at relatively low Cd levels (25 to 100 {$\mu$}mol L-1). Cadmium concentrations in leaves and stems increased with increasing Cd supply levels, and reached a maximum of approximately 9000 and 6500 mg kg-1 (DW) at 400 {$\mu$}mol Cd L-1, respectively. Root Cd concentration increased sharply only at relatively high Cd levels. Cadmium distribution in different parts of the plant was in the order: leaf {$>$} stem {$\gg$} root. The amount of Cd accumulated in the shoots reached 2.9 and 3.2 mg plant-1 at external Cd levels of 200 and 400 {$\mu$}mol L-1, respectively. The shoot/root Cd ratios were greater than 2 and more than 95\% of the total Cd taken up by S. alfredii was translocated to the shoots at the external Cd levels {$\leq$}200 {$\mu$}mol L-1. The concentrations of P, Ca, Mg, B, Fe, Mn, Cu, and in the shoots and roots were influenced differentially by Cd treatments. High Zn supply (500 {$\mu$}mol L-1) enhanced Cd concentrations in the leaves and stems at the Cd levels {$\leq$}100 {$\mu$}mol L-1, and root Cd concentration at the Cd levels {$\leq$}50 {$\mu$}mol L-1. These results indicate that S. alfredii has an extraordinary ability to tolerate and hyperaccumulate Cd and this is the first report of the new Cd hyperaccumulator S. alfredii Hance. The finding of Cd/Zn hyperaccumulation in S. alfredii Hance provides an important plant material for understanding the mechanisms of Cd/Zn co-hyperaccumulation and for phytoremediation of the heavy metal contaminated soils.},

The use of genetic engineering to modify plants for metal uptake, transport and sequestration may open up new avenues for enhancing efficiency of phytoremediation. Metal chelator, metal transporter, metallothionein (MT), and phytochelatin (PC) genes have been transferred to plants for improved metal uptake and sequestration. Transgenic plants, which detoxify/accumulate cadmium, lead, mercury, arsenic and selenium have been developed. A better understanding of the mechanisms of rhizosphere interaction, uptake, transport and sequestration of metals in hyperaccumulator plants will lead to designing novel transgenic plants with improved remediation traits. As more genes related to metal metabolism are discovered, facilitated by the genome sequencing projects, new vistas will be opened up for development of efficient transgenic plants for phytoremediation.},

Conclusions 788 Acknowledgements 789 References 789 Summary Arsenic (As) is an element that is nonessential for and toxic to plants. Arsenic contamination in the environment occurs in many regions, and, depending on environmental factors, its accumulation in food crops may pose a health risk to humans. Recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of As uptake and metabolism in plants is reviewed here. Arsenate is taken up by phosphate transporters. A number of the aquaporin nodulin26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs) are able to transport arsenite, the predominant form of As in reducing environments. In rice (Oryza sativa), arsenite uptake shares the highly efficient silicon (Si) pathway of entry to root cells and efflux towards the xylem. In root cells arsenate is rapidly reduced to arsenite, which is effluxed to the external medium, complexed by thiol peptides or translocated to shoots. One type of arsenate reductase has been identified, but its in planta functions remain to be investigated. Some fern species in the Pteridaceae family are able to hyperaccumulate As in above-ground tissues. Hyperaccumulation appears to involve enhanced arsenate uptake, decreased arsenite-thiol complexation and arsenite efflux to the external medium, greatly enhanced xylem translocation of arsenite, and vacuolar sequestration of arsenite in fronds. Current knowledge gaps and future research directions are also identified.},

Toxicity of Cr to plants depends on its valence state: Cr(VI) is highly toxic and mobile whereas Cr(III) is less toxic. Since plants lack a specific transport system for Cr, it is taken up by carriers of essential ions such as sulfate or iron. Toxic effects of Cr on plant growth and development include alterations in the germination process as well as in the growth of roots, stems and leaves, which may affect total dry matter production and yield. Cr also causes deleterious effects on plant physiological processes such as photosynthesis, water relations and mineral nutrition. Metabolic alterations by Cr exposure have also been described in plants either by a direct effect on enzymes or other metabolites or by its ability to generate reactive oxygen species which may cause oxidative stress. The potential of plants with the capacity to accumulate or to stabilize Cr compounds for bioremediation of Cr contamination has gained interest in recent years.},

  abstract = {SummaryA 3.3 kb fragment of yeast genomic DNA was isolated by screening a genomic library constructed in the high copy number 2 micron plasmid YEp351 vector for clones capable of enhancing the degree of resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain MW3070-8B to cadmium. The insert contained two complete copies of the CUP1 gene open reading frame (183 bp), including the upstream promoter sequences (450 bp) with two conserved metal responsive cis-acting elements. Northern analysis showed that addition of cadmium (0.02 {$\mu$}M) or copper (50 {$\mu$}M) to overnight liquid cultures of yeast induced expression of CUP1 transcripts from both chromosomal and plasmid-borne gene copies. The cloned 3.3 kb DNA in a high copy number plasmid restored copper resistance to the sensitive strain LS70-313{$\Delta$}, deleted for the CUP1 gene (cup1{$\Delta$}), but failed to restore cadmium resistance. Thus, CUP1 gene expression in yeast appears to be influenced differently by cadmium and copper ions. Resistance to heavy metal poisoning resulted from enhanced gene product levels attributable to amplification of the CUP1 gene as well as to increased transcriptions. Two distinct gene product levels mediate cadmium and copper resistance; a higher gene product level was required to confer cadmium resistance.},

Cells control the size of their compartments relative to cell volume, but there is also size control within each organelle. Yeast vacuoles neither burst nor do they collapse into a ruffled morphology, indicating that the volume of the organellar envelope is adjusted to the amount of content. It is poorly understood how this adjustment is achieved. We show that the accumulating content of yeast vacuoles activates fusion of other vacuoles, thus increasing the volume-to-surface ratio. Synthesis of the dominant compound stored inside vacuoles, polyphosphate, stimulates binding of the chaperone Sec18/NSF to vacuolar SNAREs, which activates them and triggers fusion. SNAREs can only be activated by lumenal, not cytosolic, polyphosphate (polyP). Control of lumenal polyP over SNARE activation in the cytosol requires the cytosolic cyclin-dependent kinase Pho80\textendash{}Pho85 and the R-SNARE Nyv1. These results suggest that cells can adapt the volume of vacuoles to their content through feedback from the vacuole lumen to the SNAREs on the cytosolic surface of the organelle.},

The Deadman kill switch uses unbalanced reciprocal transcriptional repression to couple a specific input signal with cell survival. The Passcode kill switch uses a similar two-layered transcription design and incorporates hybrid LacI-GalR family transcription factors to provide diverse and complex environmental inputs to control circuit function. These synthetic gene circuits efficiently kill Escherichia coli and can be readily reprogrammed to change their environmental inputs, regulatory architecture and killing mechanism.},
