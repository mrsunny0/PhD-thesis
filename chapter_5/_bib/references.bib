  abstract = {Almost half of all enzymes must associate with a particular metal to function. An ambition is to understand why each metal\textendash{}protein partnership arose and how it is maintained. Metal availability provides part of the explanation, and has changed over geological time and varies between habitats but is held within vital limits in cells. Such homeostasis needs metal sensors, and there is an ongoing search to discover the metal-sensing mechanisms. For metalloproteins to acquire the right metals, metal sensors must correctly distinguish between the inorganic elements.},

  abstract = {Designed for undergraduates, graduate students, and industry practitioners, Bioseparations Science and Engineering fills a critical need in the field of bioseparations. Current, comprehensive, and concise, it covers bioseparations unit operations in unprecedented depth. In each of the chapters, the authors use a consistent method of explaining unit operations, starting with a qualitative description noting the significance and general application of the unit operation. They then illustrate the scientific application of the operation, develop the required mathematical theory, and finally, describe the applications of the theory in engineering practice, with an emphasis on design and scaleup. Unique to this text is a chapter dedicated to bioseparations process design and economics, in which a process simular, SuperPro Designer(r) is used to analyze and evaluate the production of three important biological products. New to this second edition are updated discussions of moment analysis, computer simulation, membrane chromatography, and evaporation, among others, as well as revised problem sets. Unique features include basic information about bioproducts and engineering analysis and a chapter with bioseparations laboratory exercises. Bioseparations Science and Engineering is ideal for students and professionals working in or studying bioseparations, and is the premier text in the field.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the use of micro-organisms as catalysts at the electrodes of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). The principle of MFCs and their intended use for water treatment and clean electricity production is discussed. We address the different microbial structure and metabolic pathways found in prokaryote (bacteria) and eukaryote (yeasts) that allow the understanding of why electron transfer is possible between a microbe and an electrode. The different mechanisms of microbe\textendash{}electrode electron transfer are discussed: direct electron transfer or through natural nanowires (pili), mediated electron transfer by natural or artificial redox mediator and finally direct redox transformation of excreted metabolites at the electrodes. This is followed by a review of the different bacteria that have been found and studied in MFCs mainly in the anodic compartment but also more recently in the cathodic side of the fuel cells. A perspective on the possible advantages and challenges of the use of yeasts in MFCs is provided, as this aspect has not been thoroughly studied so far. The fourth section of the review focuses on how to improve the performance and sustainability of MFCs through the functionalisation of the electrode surface, for instance with the covalent grafting of redox mediators and/or enzymes.},

  abstract = {We developed a new method to measure iron reduction at a distance based on depositing Fe(III) (hydr)oxide within nanoporous glass beads. In this ``Fe-bead'' system, Shewanella oneidensis reduces at least 86.5\% of the iron in the absence of direct contact. Biofilm formation accompanies Fe-bead reduction and is observable both macro- and microscopically. Fe-bead reduction is catalyzed by live cells adapted to anaerobic conditions, and maximal reduction rates require sustained protein synthesis. The amount of reactive ferric iron in the Fe-bead system is available in excess such that the rate of Fe-bead reduction is directly proportional to cell density; i.e., it is diffusion limited. Addition of either lysates prepared from anaerobic cells or exogenous electron shuttles stimulates Fe-bead reduction by S. oneidensis, but iron chelators or additional Fe(II) do not. Neither dissolved Fe(III) nor electron shuttling activity was detected in culture supernatants, implying that the mediator is retained within the biofilm matrix. Strains with mutations in omcB or mtrB show about 50\% of the wild-type levels of reduction, while a cymA mutant shows less than 20\% of the wild-type levels of reduction and a menF mutant shows insignificant reduction. The Fe-bead reduction defect of the menF mutant can be restored by addition of menaquinone, but menaquinone itself cannot stimulate Fe-bead reduction. Because the menF gene encodes the first committed step of menaquinone biosynthesis, no intermediates of the menaquinone biosynthetic pathway are used as diffusible mediators by this organism to promote iron reduction at a distance. CymA and menaquinone are required for both direct and indirect mineral reduction, whereas MtrB and OmcB contribute to but are not absolutely required for iron reduction at a distance.},

  abstract = {SummaryA 3.3 kb fragment of yeast genomic DNA was isolated by screening a genomic library constructed in the high copy number 2 micron plasmid YEp351 vector for clones capable of enhancing the degree of resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain MW3070-8B to cadmium. The insert contained two complete copies of the CUP1 gene open reading frame (183 bp), including the upstream promoter sequences (450 bp) with two conserved metal responsive cis-acting elements. Northern analysis showed that addition of cadmium (0.02 {$\mu$}M) or copper (50 {$\mu$}M) to overnight liquid cultures of yeast induced expression of CUP1 transcripts from both chromosomal and plasmid-borne gene copies. The cloned 3.3 kb DNA in a high copy number plasmid restored copper resistance to the sensitive strain LS70-313{$\Delta$}, deleted for the CUP1 gene (cup1{$\Delta$}), but failed to restore cadmium resistance. Thus, CUP1 gene expression in yeast appears to be influenced differently by cadmium and copper ions. Resistance to heavy metal poisoning resulted from enhanced gene product levels attributable to amplification of the CUP1 gene as well as to increased transcriptions. Two distinct gene product levels mediate cadmium and copper resistance; a higher gene product level was required to confer cadmium resistance.},

The Deadman kill switch uses unbalanced reciprocal transcriptional repression to couple a specific input signal with cell survival. The Passcode kill switch uses a similar two-layered transcription design and incorporates hybrid LacI-GalR family transcription factors to provide diverse and complex environmental inputs to control circuit function. These synthetic gene circuits efficiently kill Escherichia coli and can be readily reprogrammed to change their environmental inputs, regulatory architecture and killing mechanism.},

  abstract = {Yeast cells possess a remarkable capacity to adhere to abiotic surfaces, cells and tissues. These adhesion properties are of medical and industrial relevance. Pathogenic yeasts such as Candida albicans and Candida glabrata adhere to medical devices and form drug-resistant biofilms. In contrast, cell\textendash{}cell adhesion (flocculation) is a desirable property of industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains that allows the easy separation of cells from the fermentation product. Adhesion is conferred by a class of special cell wall proteins, called adhesins. Cells carry several different adhesins, each allowing adhesion to specific substrates. Several signalling cascades including the Ras/cAMP/PKA and MAP kinase (MAPK)-dependent filamentous growth pathways tightly control synthesis of the different adhesins. Together, these pathways trigger adhesion in response to stress, nutrient limitation or small molecules produced by the host, such as auxin in plants or NAD in mammals. In addition, adhesins are subject to subtelomeric epigenetic switching, resulting in stochastic expression patterns. Internal tandem repeats within adhesin genes trigger recombination events and the formation of novel adhesins, thereby offering fungi an endless reservoir of adhesion properties. These aspects of fungal adhesion exemplify the impressive phenotypic plasticity of yeasts, allowing them to adapt quickly to stressful environments and exploit new opportunities.},

  abstract = {This review paper serves to describe the composition and activity of a biologically active carbon (BAC) biofilm used in water purification. An analysis of several physical\textendash{}chemical, biochemical and microbiological methods (indicators) used to characterize the BAC biofilm's composition and activity is provided. As well, the ability of the biofilm to remove and biodegrade waterborne organic substances and pollutants will be reviewed, with context to other industrial processes such as pre-ozonation and post-membrane filtration. Strategies to control the growth of the BAC biofilm, such as varying the nutrient loading rate, manipulating influent DO and pH levels, altering the frequency of BAC filter backwashing and applying oxidative disinfection, will be described in detail along with their respective process control challenges.},
