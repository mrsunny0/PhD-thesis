  abstract = {Cell buoyant densities of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were determined for rapidly growing asynchronous and synchronous cultures by equilibrium sedimentation in Percoll gradients. The average cell density in exponentially growing cultures was 1.1126 g/ml, with a range of density variation of 0.010 g/ml. Densities were highest for cells with buds about one-fourth the diameter of their mother cells and lowest when bud diameters were about the same as their mother cells. In synchronous cultures inoculated from the least-dense cells, there was no observable perturbation of cell growth: cell numbers increased without lag, and the doubling time (66 min) was the same as that for the parent culture. Starting from a low value at the beginning of the cycle, cell buoyant density oscillated between a maximum density near midcycle (0.4 generations) and a minimum near the end of the cycle (0.9 generations). The pattern of cyclic variation of buoyant density was quantitatively determined from density measurements for five cell classes, which were categorized by bud diameter. The observed variation in buoyant density during the cell cycle of S. cerevisiae contrasts sharply with the constancy in buoyant density observed for cells of Escherichia coli, Chinese hamster cells, and three murine cell lines.},

  abstract = {Accumulation of heavy metals without developing toxicity symptoms is a phenotype restricted to a small group of plants called hyperaccumulators, whose metal-related characteristics suggested the high potential in biotechnologies such as bioremediation and bioextraction. In an attempt to extrapolate the heavy metal hyperaccumulating phenotype to yeast, we obtained Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells armed with non-natural metal-binding hexapeptides targeted to the inner face of the plasma membrane, expected to sequester the metal ions once they penetrated the cell. We describe the construction of S. cerevisiae strains overexpressing metal-binding hexapeptides (MeBHxP) fused to the carboxy-terminus of a myristoylated green fluorescent protein (myrGFP). Three non-toxic myrGFP-MeBHxP (myrGFP-H6, myrGFP-C6, and myrGFP-(DE)3) were investigated against an array of heavy metals in terms of their effect on S. cerevisiae growth, heavy metal (hyper) accumulation, and capacity to remove heavy metal from contaminated environments.},

  abstract = {The metalloregulatory protein MerR, which exhibits high affinity and selectivity toward mercury, was exploited for the construction of microbial biosorbents specific for mercury removal. Whole-cell sorbents were constructed with MerR genetically engineered onto the surface of Escherichia coli cells by using an ice nucleation protein anchor. The presence of surface-exposed MerR on the engineered strains enabled sixfold-higher Hg2+ biosorption than that found in the wild-type JM109 cells. Hg2+ binding via MerR was very specific, with no observable decline even in the presence of 100-fold excess Cd2+ and Zn2+. The Hg2+ binding property of the whole-cell sorbents was also insensitive to different ionic strengths, pHs, and the presence of metal chelators. Since metalloregulatory proteins are currently available for a wide variety of toxic heavy metals, our results suggest that microbial biosorbents overexpressing metalloregulatory proteins may be used similarly for the cleanup of other important heavy metals.},

  abstract = {To increase the level of adsorption of heavy metal ions in surface-engineered yeasts, a yeast metallothionein (YMT) was tandemly fused and displayed by means of an {$\alpha$}-agglutinin-based display system. The display of the YMT and its tandem repeats was examined by immunofluorescent labeling. The adsorption and recovery of Cd2+ on the cell surface was increasingly enhanced with increasing number of tandem repeats. All Cd2+-binding sites in the YMT tandem repeats were suggested to be completely occupied. To investigate the relationship between cell-surface adsorption and protection against heavy metal ion toxicity, the tolerance of these surface-engineered yeasts to Cd2+ was examined by growing in Cd2+-containing liquid medium. The rate of growth was found to be dependent on the number of displayed tandem repeats of YMT. These results suggest that the characteristics of surface-engineered yeasts as a bioadsorbent were dependent on the ability of the displayed proteins to bind metal ions, and the adsorption of heavy metal ions on the cell surface plays a major role in the ability of the cells to resist the toxic effects of metal ions.},

  abstract = {Beginning biology students are introduced to the macromolecules of the cell (proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and carbohydrates) as being the key players in cellular function.  What is disturbingly deceptive about this picture is that it makes no reference to the many ion species without which cells could not function at all.   Ions have a huge variety of roles in cells.  Several of our favorites include the role of ions in electrical communication (Na+, K+, Ca2+), as cofactors in dictating protein function with entire classes of metalloproteins (constituting by some estimates at least \textonequarter{} of all proteins) in processes ranging from photosynthesis to human respiration (Mn2+, Mg2+, Fe2+), as a stimulus for signaling and muscle action (Ca2+), and as the basis for setting up transmembrane potentials that are then used to power key processes such as ATP synthesis (H+, Na+).},
