Display of YMT and hexa-His by {$\alpha$}-agglutinin-based cell-surface engineering was confirmed by immunofluorescent labeling. Surface-engineered yeast cells with YMT and hexa-His fused in tandem showed superior cell-surface adsorption and recovery of Cd2+ under EDTA treatment on the cell surface than hexa-His-displaying cells. YMT was demonstrated to be more effective than hexa-His for the adsorption of Cd2+. Yeast cells displaying YMT and/or hexa-His exhibited a higher potential for the adsorption of Cd2+ than Escherichia coli cells displaying these molecules. In order to investigate the effect of the displayed YMT and hexa-His on sensitivity to toxic Cd2+, growth in Cd2+-containing liquid medium was monitored. Unlike hexa-His-displaying cells, cells displaying YMT and hexa-His fused in tandem induced resistance to Cd2+ through active and enhanced adsorption of toxic Cd2+. These results indicate that YMT-displaying yeast cells are a unique bioadsorbent with a functional chelating ability superior to that of E. coli.},

We describe the construction of S. cerevisiae strains overexpressing metal-binding hexapeptides (MeBHxP) fused to the carboxy-terminus of a myristoylated green fluorescent protein (myrGFP). Three non-toxic myrGFP-MeBHxP (myrGFP-H6, myrGFP-C6, and myrGFP-(DE)3) were investigated against an array of heavy metals in terms of their effect on S. cerevisiae growth, heavy metal (hyper) accumulation, and capacity to remove heavy metal from contaminated environments.},

  abstract = {Filament-forming cytoskeletal proteins are essential for the structure and organization of all cells. Bacterial homologues of the major eukaryotic cytoskeletal families have now been discovered, but studies suggest that yet more remain to be identified. We demonstrate that the metabolic enzyme CTP synthase (CtpS) forms filaments in Caulobacter crescentus. CtpS is bifunctional, as the filaments it forms regulate the curvature of C. crescentus cells independently of its catalytic function. The morphogenic role of CtpS requires its functional interaction with the intermediate filament, crescentin (CreS). Interestingly, the Escherichia coli CtpS homologue also forms filaments both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that CtpS polymerization may be widely conserved. E. coli CtpS can replace the enzymatic and morphogenic functions of C. crescentus CtpS, indicating that C. crescentus has adapted a conserved filament-forming protein for a secondary role. These results implicate CtpS as a novel bifunctional member of the bacterial cytoskeleton and suggest that localization and polymerization may be important properties of metabolic enzymes.},

The native enzyme equilibrated between monomers, dimers, and tetramers in the absence of substrates. At enzyme concentrations above 5 {$\mathrm{\mu}$} , tetramers represented 40\% of the species in solution. Inactivation by 6-d\'iazo-5-oxonorleucine (DON) or thiourea dioxide reduced the amount of tetramer to below detectable limits. However, inactivated enzyme still equilibrated between monomers and dimers. Simultaneous analysis of multispeed data at three protein concentrations yielded estimates of the dissociation constants for the monomer\textemdash{}dimer and dimer\textemdash{}tetramer equilibria. For multiple data sets of native enzyme, K\textbackslash\textquestiondown{} was between 1 and 2 {$\mathrm{\mu}$} , and Kz,a was between 1 and 18 {$\mathrm{\mu}$} . For DON inactivated enzyme, Ki\textquestiondown{} was 3\textemdash{}4 {$\mathrm{\mu}$} , and for thiourea dioxide inactivated enzyme, K\textbackslash\textquestiondown{} was \guillemotleft\textquestiondown{}1 {$\mathrm{\mu}$} . The values for K\textbackslash\textquestiondown{} are consistent with previously published studies by gel filtration, demonstrating that the enzyme dissociates to monomers in very dilute solution (Anderson, 1983). However, the sedimentation equilibrium experiments are the first to show that the enzyme forms tetramers in the absence of nucleotides. This result implies the presence of stable conformations in the native enzyme capable of dynamic equilibrium between monomers, dimers, and tetramers. The results presented here illustrate the sensitivity of sedimentation equilibrium for measuring the aggregation state of equilibrating enzyme species and demonstrate that active site modifications disrupt the quaternary structure of CTP synthetase.},

When {$\approx$}800 yeast strains expressing GFP-tagged proteins were grown to stationary phase, a surprising number of proteins involved in intermediary metabolism and stress response were observed to form punctate cytoplasmic foci. The formation of these discrete physical structures was confirmed by immunofluorescence and mass spectrometry of untagged proteins. The purine biosynthetic enzyme Ade4-GFP formed foci in the absence of adenine, and cycling between punctate and diffuse phenotypes could be controlled by adenine subtraction and addition. Similarly, glutamine synthetase (Gln1-GFP) foci cycled reversibly in the absence and presence of glucose. The structures were neither targeted for vacuolar or autophagosome degradation nor colocalized with P bodies or major organelles. Thus, upon nutrient depletion we observe widespread protein assemblies displaying nutrient-specific formation and dissolution.},

The presence of surface-exposed MerR on the engineered strains enabled sixfold-higher Hg2+ biosorption than that found in the wild-type JM109 cells. Hg2+ binding via MerR was very specific, with no observable decline even in the presence of 100-fold excess Cd2+ and Zn2+. The Hg2+ binding property of the whole-cell sorbents was also insensitive to different ionic strengths, pHs, and the presence of metal chelators. Since metalloregulatory proteins are currently available for a wide variety of toxic heavy metals, our results suggest that microbial biosorbents overexpressing metalloregulatory proteins may be used similarly for the cleanup of other important heavy metals.},

  abstract = {Expressing proteins of interest as fusions to proteins of the bacterial envelope is a powerful technique with many biotechnological and medical applications. Autotransporters have recently emerged as a good tool for bacterial surface display. These proteins are composed of an N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a passenger domain and a translocator domain that mediates the outer membrane translocation of the passenger. The natural passenger domain of autotransporters can be replaced by heterologous proteins that become displayed at the bacterial surface by the translocator domain. The simplicity and versatility of this system has made it very attractive and it has been used to display functional enzymes, vaccine antigens as well as polypeptides libraries. The recent advances in the study of the translocation mechanism of autotransporters have raised several controversial issues with implications for their use as display systems. These issues include the requirement for the displayed polypeptides to remain in a translocation-competent state in the periplasm, the requirement for specific signal sequences and "autochaperone" domains, and the influence of the genetic background of the expression host strain. It is therefore important to better understand the mechanism of translocation of autotransporters in order to employ them to their full potential. This review will focus on the recent advances in the study of the translocation mechanism of autotransporters and describe practical considerations regarding their use for bacterial surface display.},

  abstract = {A reinvestigation of the metal ion activation ahd specificity of CTP synthetase was begun in order to separate effects due to binding of free metal ions and binding of nucleotide-complexed ions. ApoCTP synthetase was prepared by dialysis against 5 mM EDTA. Analysis of apo-enzyme by atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed that all bound metal ions could be removed. Thus, apo-enzyme contained no detectable amounts of Mg2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, or Fe2+. The half-saturation value for Mg2+-dependent enzyme activatibn was approximately 2.6 mM at a total concentration of 2 mM nucleotides (ATP plus UTP). These data suggest that the enzyme requires more Mg2+ for full catalytic activity than required simply to complex the nucleotide substrates. Analysis of velocity versus [Mg2+]free demonstrated that activity depends on [Mg2+]free. The half-saturation values for [Mg2+]free were 660 and 280 {$\mathrm{\mu}$} in the NH4+and glutamine-dependent assays, respectively. The half-saturation values for [Mn2+]free and [Co2+]free were approximately 2.6 and 3.8 {$\mathrm{\mu}$} in the NH4+-dependent assay and 2.8 and 4.7 {$\mathrm{\mu}$} in the glutamine-dependent assay. These results are consistent with the presence of a separate binding site for free metal ion on the enzyme. Over the range of 0.1-10 mM, neither Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, nor Ca2+ activated the enzyme. Also, both Cu2+ and Zn2+ were effective inhibitors of CTP synthetase in the absence of dithiothreitol at concentrations {$<$}50 {$\mathrm{\mu}$} . Inhibition by Zn2+ was reversed by EDTA, whereas inhibition by Cu2+ was not. In the presence of dithio\'iHfeitol, Zn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ inhibited the enzyme at less than 200 {$\mathrm{\mu}$} metal ion. In steady-state inhibition experiments, Zn2+ and Cu2+ demonstrated noncompetitive inhibition with respect to [Mg2+]free, where A\textexclamdown{}s and K\textexclamdown\textexclamdown{} were 0.3 and 0.8 {$\mathrm{\mu}$} for Zn2+ and 18 and 80 {$\mathrm{\mu}$} for Cu2+, respectively. The suggestion that free metal ions bind to apo-CTP synthetase was confirmed by fluorescence and electron spin resonance measurements. Addition of Zn2+ to apo-enzyme resulted in an increase in the native tryptophan fluorescence, and addition of apo-enzyme to solutions of Mn2+free resulted in decreases in the EPR signal of Mn2+frK. Both of these experiments provide the first physical measurements of free metal ion binding to CTP synthetase.},

  abstract = {Since immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) was first reported, several modifications have been developed. Among them, Ni2+ immobilized by chelation with nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) bound to a solid support has become the most common method for the purification of proteins carrying either a C- or N-terminal histidine (His) tag. Despite its broad application in protein purification, only little is known about the binding properties of the His-tag, and therefore almost no thermodynamic and kinetic data are available. In this study, we investigated the binding mechanism of His-tags to Ni2+-NTA. Different series of oligohistidines and mixed oligohistidines/oligoalanines were synthesized using automated solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). Binding to Ni2+-NTA was analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using commercially available NTA sensor chips from Biacore. The hexahistidine tag shows an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 14 {$\pm$} 1 nM and thus the highest affinity of the peptides synthesized in this study. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that two His separated by either one or four residues are the preferred binding motifs within hexahis tag. Finally, elongation of these referred motifs decreased affinity, probably due to increased entropy costs upon binding. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Water treatment infrastructure faces numerous operational and financial challenges in most regions of the world. Ion exchange is a water treatment technology that can be used to remove various contaminants in drinking water and has shown increased adoption in recent years due to its operational advantages; however, limited research has been conducted on the environmental and economic sustainability of ion exchange systems. This study utilizes life cycle assessment and cost analysis to holistically evaluate environmental and economic impacts of ion exchange technology that is used for reduction of disinfection by-products via organics removal in eight drinking water treatment plants in Florida. A functional unit accounting for both water quantity and quality was used and showed to have a significant effect on the evaluation results. Impact assessment results show that the construction phase has negligible environmental impact in comparison to the operation phase. Systems that use fixed bed reactors with conventional resin were compared with systems using completely mixed flow reactors with magnetic ion exchange resin. Fixed bed systems evaluated have higher salt usage and brine waste production, but use less electricity, resin, and require less transport of materials. This tradeoff causes fixed bed systems to have a higher environmental impact in categories of eutrophication, carcinogenics, non-carcinogenics, and ecotoxicity but lower impact in other categories. Furthermore, it causes fixed bed systems to have a lower operation cost compared with completely mixed systems. Results also show that both environmental impacts and operation costs per functional unit decrease with scale, similar to economies of scale effects.},

The structure of the TCR is very similar to that of antibodies, but the engineering of TCRs by directed evolution with combinatorial display libraries has not been accomplished to date. Here, we report that yeast surface display of a TCR was achieved only after the mutation of specific variable region residues. These residues are located in two regions of the TCR, at the interface of the {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-chains and in the {$\beta$}-chain framework region that is thought to be in proximity to the CD3 signal-transduction complex. The mutations are encoded naturally in many antibody variable regions, indicating specific functional differences that have not been appreciated between TCRs and antibodies. The identification of these residues provides an explanation for the inherent difficulties in the display of wild-type TCRs compared with antibodies. Yeast-displayed mutant TCRs bind specifically to the peptide/MHC antigen, enabling engineering of soluble T cell receptors as specific T cell antagonists. This strategy of random mutagenesis followed by selection for surface expression may be of general use in the directed evolution of other eukaryotic proteins that are refractory to display.},

The rapid growth in product demand for mAbs triggered parallel efforts to increase production capacity through construction of large bulk manufacturing plants as well as improvements in cell culture processes to raise product titers. This combination has led to an excess of manufacturing capacity, and together with improvements in conventional purification technologies, promises nearly unlimited production capacity in the foreseeable future. The increase in titers has also led to a marked reduction in production costs, which could then become a relatively small fraction of sales price for future products which are sold at prices at or near current levels. The reduction of capacity and cost pressures for current state-of-the-art bulk production processes may shift the focus of process development efforts and have important implications for both plant design and product development strategies for both biopharmaceutical and contract manufacturing companies.},

Here I describe the identification of a novel intracellular structure containing CTP synthase, termed the cytoophidium, in Drosophila cells. I find that cytoophidia are present in all major cell types in the ovary and exist in a wide range of tissues such as brain, gut, trachea, testis, accessory gland, salivary gland and lymph gland. In addition, I find CTP synthase-containing cytoophidia in other fruit fly species. The observation of compartmentation of CTP synthase now permits a broad range of questions to be addressed concerning not only the structure and function of cytoophidia but also the organization and regulation of CTP synthesis.},

In the present study, the formation of these conserved structures in mammalian cells and functions linked to these structures were examined. Methodology/Principal Findings Distinct cytoplasmic rods ({$\sim$}3\textendash{}10 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}m in length) and rings ({$\sim$}2\textendash{}5 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}m in diameter) in HEp-2 cells were initially observed in immunofluorescence using human autoantibodies. Co-localization studies revealed that, although RR had filament-like features, they were not enriched in actin, tubulin, or vimentin, and not associated with centrosomes or other known cytoplasmic structures. Further independent studies revealed that two key enzymes in the nucleotide synthetic pathway cytidine triphosphate synthase 1 (CTPS1) and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) were highly enriched in RR. CTPS1 enzyme inhibitors 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine and Acivicin as well as the IMPDH2 inhibitor Ribavirin exhibited dose-dependent induction of RR in {$>$}95\% of cells in all cancer cell lines tested as well as mouse primary cells. RR formation by lower concentration of Ribavirin was enhanced in IMPDH2-knockdown HeLa cells whereas it was inhibited in GFP-IMPDH2 overexpressed HeLa cells. Interestingly, RR were detected readily in untreated mouse embryonic stem cells ({$>$}95\%); upon retinoic acid differentiation, RR disassembled in these cells but reformed when treated with Acivicin. Conclusions/Significance RR formation represented response to disturbances in the CTP or GTP synthetic pathways in cancer cell lines and mouse primary cells and RR are the convergence physical structures in these pathways. The availability of specific markers for these conserved structures and the ability to induce formation in vitro will allow further investigations in structure and function of RR in many biological systems in health and diseases.},

  abstract = {The unique capacity of glutamine synthetase to form highly insoluble paracrystalline aggregates in the presence of Zn2+ and Mg2+ mixtures is the basis of a new simple procedure for the isolation of the enzyme from crude extracts of Escherichia coli. Under optimal conditions (pH 5.85, 25 \textdegree{}C, 1.5 mm ZnSO4 and 50 MgCl2 over 95\% of the enzyme is precipitated from crude extracts; differential extraction of the precipitate with dilute buffer (pH 7.0) containing 2.5 mm MgCl2 leads to high yields of almost pure glutamine synthetase. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme shows it to consist of one major protein and two minor protein components, all of which exhibit glutamine synthetase activity. The major component appears to be identical with the enzyme previously isolated by the older more tedious procedure of Woolfolk et al. (1966). The {$\gamma$}-glutamyl transferase activity of enzyme isolated by the new procedure is the same as that isolated by the older method, but its biosynthetic activity is 25\textendash{}35\% lower. In all other respects examined (i.e., divalent ion specificity, pH optimum, apparent Km values for substrates, susceptibility to feedback inhibition and physical properties) enzymes prepared by the old and the new procedures are indistinguishable. From studies with pure glutamine synthetase isolated by either procedure, it has been established that paracrystalline aggregation does not occur until 9\textendash{}10 equivs of Zn2+ are bound per mole of enzyme. The high specificity of Zn2+ in inducing enzyme aggregation, suggests that its binding provokes a unique conformational state of the enzyme. This is supported by the fact that addition of Zn2+ to relaxed (divalent cation free) enzyme elicits a change in the ultraviolet spectrum of the enzyme that is qualitatively different from that caused by either Mg2+ or Mn2+. Moreover, in contrast to Mg2+, the binding of Zn2+ decreases the fluorescence associated with the binding of 2-p-toludinyl-naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid to the enzyme, suggesting that Zn2+ binding is accompanied by a decrease in the number of exposed hydrophobic regions on the enzyme.},

  abstract = {Separation processes using ion exchange materials are ubiquitous regarding the selective removal of contaminants of environmental concern. Recently, highly regulated contaminants, such as arsenic, have gained notoriety on account of carcinogenic effects and subsequent promulgation of new drinking water standards by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Other nonregulated compounds such as hardness (e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+), pose a particular concern to avoid scaling in heat-transfer equipment, foulingz in membranes, and high consumption of detergents and sequestering chemicals in cooling and wash water. In general, ion exchange processes used to remove hardness generate concentrated brine or mineral acid as a waste regenerant stream. Residuals management and long-term sustainability issues will continue to be major concerns with these processes. The subject paper reports and discusses the results and attributes of two new separation processes using ion exchange fibers (IX-fibers). The first process involves the selective removal of arsenic using hybridized IX-fibers that contain dispersed hydrated ferric oxide (HFO) nanoparticles. Anion-exchanger-supported HFO particles offered a high arsenic removal capacity; less than 10\% of influent arsenic broke through after 30,000 bed volumes. Hybrid fibers were also amenable to efficient regeneration with 2\% NaOH and 2\% NaCl and capable of simultaneous removal of both arsenic(V) and arsenic(III). The second process involves the environmentally benign removal of hardness. Most importantly, this process uses harvested snowmelt (or rainwater) sparged with carbon dioxide as the regenerant. Consequently, the spent regenerant does not contain a high concentration of aggressive chemicals such as sodium chloride or acid like traditional ion-exchange processes nor does the process produce voluminous sludges as does lime softening. The bulk of carbon dioxide consumed during regeneration remains sequestered in the aqueous phase as alkalinity. For both treatment strategies, IX-fibers form the heart of the process. They are essentially thin cylindrical polymeric strands 10\textendash{}20 {$\mu$}m in diameter with functional groups residing near to the fiber surface. Low intraparticle diffusional resistance is the underlying reason why calcium loaded weak acid IX-fibers are amenable to efficient regeneration using either snowmelt or rainwater sparged with carbon dioxide. Additionally, for hybrid IX-fibers, enhanced adsorption kinetics may offer the possibility for certain point of use applications, which are unavailable to their resin counterparts. \textcopyright{} 2006 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2006},
